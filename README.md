## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd weather-app


2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Environment Variables
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Run in Development
npm run dev

5. Build for Production
npm run build
npm run preview

Assumptions & Trade-offs
Using free tier Weather API (limited requests e.g 3 days forecast only).
Offline mode uses last fetched data (not background sync).
Location search limited to WeatherAPI city database.
Location services are permission-based â€” fallback to default location (Malta) if denied.

Improvements (If Given More Time)
Add weather maps (radar, precipitation) for visual context.
Implement background sync to refresh weather automatically when online.
